# Register Database Web Application

This is my personal project where I am creating a web application integrated with a MongoDB database.  
The application allows users to store and manage personal data, such as names and phone numbers, in a secure and efficient way.  

## Features
- **Add new entries**: Save user data, including phone numbers and names, to the database.
- **Retrieve stored data**: Fetch the stored information directly from MongoDB.
- **Built with simplicity in mind**: Easy to set up and run locally.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Basic HTML/JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Node.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Juhok1/registerdatabase2.git cd registerdatabase
2.  Install dependencies: npm install
3.  Start the application: node app.js
4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication.
- Build a more dynamic frontend using frameworks like React or Vue.
